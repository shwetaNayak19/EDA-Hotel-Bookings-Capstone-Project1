# EDA-Hotel-Bookings Analysis


We are doing data analysis on hotel booking, the data set contains booking information for city hotel 
and resort hotel and includes information such as, when the booking was made, length of stay, the number 
of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things.


We are doing analysis in following ways,

 Data collections and loading,

 Data wrangling and cleaning, 

 Exploratory data analysis.

With these steps, we have prepared a set of questionnaires and accordingly executed analysis based on 
each question. Before analysis, we have arranged the data in proper format and then explained them 
thorough various graphs and charts. We have used Pandas for data loading and Matplotlib for
visualization.

In data cleaning process, we have done handling missing values, removing duplicate data, converting 
columns to proper d-type format, and adding or removing some columns for further analysis.
For Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we have checked correlation of numerical data and time series 
analysis by plotting different graphs and charts. 

we have performed the exploratory data analysis to extract information from the data to 

From the analysis, we get
